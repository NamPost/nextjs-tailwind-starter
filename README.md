# NamPost Next JS Starter 

This is a a NamPost starter template for projects based on NextJS 13, Tailwind CSS, React Query, Next-Auth and Jotai state management.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo, then, install dependencies and run the dev server.

Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn 
```

Finally, run the development server:

```bash

yarn dev
```

By default the local server will run on port 3001 (http://localhost:3001). To change this, simply set the port env variable in the package.json.
